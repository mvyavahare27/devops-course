	Menstrual leave is a type of leave where a woman may have the option to take paid or unpaid leave from her employment if she is menstruating and is unable to go to work because of this.[1][2] According to a study, out of the 40% of women who are part of the labor force 20% experience a condition called dysmenorrhea that causes pain during menstruation.[3][4] Menstrual leave is controversial because it is seen by some as a criticism of women's work efficiency or as sexism.[5][6][7] Meanwhile, those who support menstrual leave policies compare its function to that of maternity leave and view it as a promoter of gender equality.[8]
